# Lab1 - E2E Testing

We will start our working in this lab by testing a relatively
simple component. The Cypress Heroes app's main feature is the ability to hire a hero, so let's write some tests around that.


## Getting Started

To get started, make checkout the `lab1-start` branch:

```
git checkout lab1-start
```

You can find a completed version of this lab in the [lab1-complete](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-heroes-workshop/tree/lab1-complete) branch.

If the app is not currently running, start it:

```bash title='./client'
npm run start
```
