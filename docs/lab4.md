# Lab4 - API Testing

We will finish our workshop in this lab by testing our API. Logging in as a user is a vital part of our application, so let's write some tests around the `/auth` endpoint.


## Getting Started

To get started, make checkout the `lab4-start` branch:

```
git checkout lab4-start
```

You can find a completed version of this lab in the [lab4-complete](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-heroes-workshop/tree/lab4-complete) branch.

If the app is not currently running, start it:

```bash title='./server'
npm run start
```
